## What is The Would Box?

The Would Box is a relationship strengthening app based on a simple but profound principle: **serving your partner's actual needs, not what you think they need**.

Like a feed box with two lids that must both open to nourish what's inside, The Would Box requires both partners to participate - one declaring needs, the other choosing what they would do.

## How It Works

### 1. **Declare Your Needs** üìù
- List what you actually need from your partner
- Secretly mark your top 3 (they earn triple points!)
- Update weekly as needs evolve

### 2. **Choose Your Woulds** üì¶
- See your partner's needs list
- Select 5 you're willing to commit to
- These get "boxed" as your commitments

### 3. **Set Priorities** üéØ
- Drag to reorder your 5 woulds
- Top 2 earn double points when completed
- Shows your partner what matters most to you

### 4. **Daily Service** üåÖ
- Each day, get one random would to focus on
- Work on whichever you choose
- Mark complete when done

### 5. **Weekly Guessing Game** üé≤
- Guess which woulds your partner completed
- Earn points for correct guesses
- Secret top needs earn triple points when served!

## Scoring System

- **Guesser**: 1 point per guess
- **Doer**: 2 points per correct guess
- **Top 2 Priorities**: Double points
- **Secret Top 3 Needs**: Triple points

## Philosophy

The Would Box operates on these principles:

1. **Commitment Before Love**: Love grows from committed acts of service
2. **Listen First**: Start by understanding actual needs, not assumed ones
3. **Choose Freely**: Select what you're genuinely willing to do
4. **Daily Practice**: Small consistent acts build strong relationships

## Technical Features

- **Progressive Web App**: Works like a native app on phones
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet once installed
- **User Isolation**: Each partner's data is properly separated
- **Local Storage**: Privacy-first, data stays on your device
- **Pairing Codes**: Simple 4-digit codes to connect partners

## The Feed Box Metaphor

```
     /\        Two lids that open
    /  \       to feed what's inside
   /____\      
  [  ‚ù§Ô∏è  ]     Love grows from
  [______]     mutual feeding
```

Each partner:
- Fills their side with needs
- Opens to receive from the other
- Creates love through willing service
